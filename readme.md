# ofxFft is an addon for [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/)

ofxFft wraps two libraries with the same interface: FFTW and KISS FFT. KISS FFT is MIT licensed, and enabled by default. FFTW is GPL, and can be enabled using the `#define USE_FFTW` flag.

To use ofxFft with FFTW make sure you download the [precompiled libraries](https://github.com/downloads/kylemcdonald/ofxFft/fftw-libs.zip).

Basic usage is demonstrated by example-eq and example-basic.

To install ofxFft, move the ofxFft folder to your `of/addons/` folder.

With each project, you need to:

1. Add to your compiler search path:
  `of/addons/ofxFft/src/`  
  `of/addons/ofxFft/libs/kiss`

2. If you're using FFTW on Windows, you'll also need to add:
  of/libs/fftw/include/
  And link with:
  of/addons/lib/fftw/lib/win32/libfftw3f-3.dll


If you're not using FFTW on Windows, you'll need to remove the line:

  #define USE_FFTW

From ofxFft.h

FFTW was compiled with:

./configure --disable-shared --enable-static --enable-float --enable-threads
make
sudo make install

which puts the static libraries in .libs
